[i]A fair item distribution in co-op[/i]

This mod assigns each encountered item to a single player, making the item available only for the selected player.

[h3]Why[/h3]
The goal is to avoid endless discussion about who should get which items in co-op.

[h3]Item protection[/h3]
In addition to the overlay showing the head and the number of the selected player, the mod completely denies unauthorized players to collect the item.

[h3]Fairness[/h3]
The mod tries to create a fair distribution of the items based on the item pools (each player will end up with approximately the same amount of treasure room items, angel room items, etc...)

If all players have the same number of items from the pool, the item is attributed by following an order randomly chosen at the beginning of the run.

[h3]I don't want this item...[/h3]
A player can offer its items to the other players by pressing all 4 shoot buttons (A, B, X, Y) at the same time. This lets any player pick up the item, until the players leave the room. The keyboard user can also press the 'o' key (this is useful if your keyboard doesn't allow some key combinations due to ghosting).

[h3]Exceptions[/h3]
Items that cost hearts and active items are not affected by the mod, as the distribution of those items is more subjective. In addition, items that only benefit the team and not the player are not affected by the mod. Finally, when playing Tainted Cain, the mod is inactive for the run due to its special mechanics.
